# The Alipsa Analytical Suite of tools

The goal of the Alipsa Analytical Suite of tools (https://github.com/Alipsa) aims to provide a complete, open source, analytics and data science suite for the Java Virtual Machine that is powerful and yet intuitive and delightful to use.

It supports the ingestion of data in various formats, transforming that data into structured information in the form of intuitive data structures that are easy to visualize and work with. That transformation can then be transformed into knowledge with the help of powerful statistical methods, artificial intelligence, and graphical visualizations all done in a beautiful and powerful integrated development environment.

This is made possible by the following open source projects that compose the suite:
- [_Groovy_](https://groovy-lang.org/) - The programming language making data analysis and data science task powerful and intuitive
- [_Matrix_](https://github.com/Alipsa/matrix) -  A groovy library defining tabular data structures, data ingestion from various formats, statistical operations, and graphical visualizations
- [_GMD_](https://github.com/Alipsa/gmd) - A Markdown dialect allowing you to embed groovy code snippets with text enabling reproducible research.
- [_Journo_](https://github.com/Alipsa/journo) - A library for creating html or pdf based on the freemarker template syntax. Those reports can be available on demand or scheduled and emailed at designated intervals.
- [_Gade_](https://github.com/Alipsa/gade) - A groovy analytics development environment that integrates all the tools above and provides a delightful development environment for analysts.  
- [_Munin_](https://github.com/Alipsa/munin) - A web based reporting server able to produce reports in html or pdf with support for GMD and Journo reporting formats.
